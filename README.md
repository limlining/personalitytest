This test is not a diagnosis — it’s a simple, supportive way to help you understand your recent emotions, stress levels, and overall mental well-being.
Through a few easy questions, you will be able to:
🌿 Notice changes in your mood
🌿 Understand your stress level and possible causes
🌿 Identify areas where you may need rest or adjustment
🌿 Receive basic self-care suggestions
Your responses are completely confidential, and the results are shown only to you.
If your results suggest that you may need additional support, remember that reaching out to a mental health professional is always a valid and encouraged step.
